Mersenne Twister version 4.1 — A high quality pseudorandom number generator for C# programmers

Mersenne Twister is a long period, fast, high quality pseudorandom number generator. Its period is 2^19937 -1 (approximately 10^6002). It has 623-dimensional equidistribution. The Mersenne Twister algorithm, by Makoto Matsumoto and Takuji Nishimura (1998), has a sound theoretical basis and has been tested thoroughly.

This was taken from "*Mersenne Twister version 4.1 — A high quality pseudorandom number generator for Visual Basic .NET programmers*". I consider this under the same license as the original code. Source for the VisualBasic version is included under the OriginalSources.zip file. Only the working class has been converted.
